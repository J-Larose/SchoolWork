		<h3>Evaluation</h3>
		<p>Students will be evaluated in this course according to the following measures: 

		<table style=" width:50%">
			<tr><th>Component</th>
				<th>Weight</th>
				</tr>
			<tr><td>Tutorials (x10)</td>
				<td>10% (1% each)</td>
				</tr>
			
			<tr><td>Assignments (x5)</td>
				<td>35% (7% each)</td>
				</tr>
			
			<tr><td>Mid-term exam </td>
				<td>15%</td>

				</tr>
		</table>
		</p>

		
		<h3>Assignments</h3>
		<ul><li>There will be 5 assignments in this course which will be available on the course web page.</li>
			<li>All assignments should be completed on an individual basis (no working in pairs or groups). </li>
			<li>All assignments are counted equally towards the final grade. </li>
			<li>Assignments must be handed in before or on the due date and time. </li>
			<li>You will be using Carleton's cuLearn system to submit your assignments and view your grades throughout the term. </li>
			<li>Always keep a backup of your work. Online backups such as email or <a href="https://db.tt/2WvhNHHY">Dropbox</a> are recommended. That way you can access your code from anywhere. </li>
			<li>You should take the time to ensure that assignments are neat, legible and easy to understand. A portion of your grade for assignments will be given for the readability of them and for your demonstration that you have completed the assigned tasks.</li>
			<li>Any instructions required by the teaching assistants (for example any assumptions you made about the assignment) should be clearly indicated on a separate README.TXT file, included with the assignment.</li> 
			<li>Remember, it is YOUR responsibility to demonstrate that you have understood and completed the assignment. Pay special attention to the submission guidelines included at the bottom of each assignment. </li>
			<li>The cuLearn system allows you to view your marks on-line. You should ensure that the posted marks are correct. </li>
			<li>Any complaints regarding assignment marks should be brought to the attention of the TA who marked it (only if the TA does not address the problem to your satisfaction should you bring the matter to the instructor). </li>
			<li>This should be done <b>no later than two weeks</b> after the assignment has been returned to you. After this time, no remarking will be done. </li>
			<li>You will be given ample time to complete each assignment. Start early and keep submitting partially completed versions. That way, if you get sick, your partially completed version will be marked, and you will not get 0. </li>
			<li>Being "sick" on the day an assignment is due is not an excuse for not doing it. Last minute issues such as a home internet failure are not considered acceptable excuses. </li>
			
			<li>Late assignments may be marked at the instructor/TA's discretion with a <b>penalty of 25% per day.</b> </li>
			<li>DO NOT email your assignments to any TAs unless requested to do so.</li>
			<li>If you are sick for an extended period of time, please inform the instructor (not the TAs). You will need to have official documentation of illness. At this point, it will be up to the instructor's discretion as to how to handle the situation.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>Midterm</h3>
		<p>The midterm will be closed-book and will cover material discussed up to the lecture prior to the midterm.
		The date for the midterm is tentatively scheduled for October 18th during regularly scheduled lecture.
		Your test must be handed back immediately when completed in order to be graded. You must attend and write the midterm. If sick, you must inform the instructor via email by the day before at the latest, and you will need official documentation as well. Exceptions are only granted at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
		
		<h3>Tutorials</h3>
		<p>Attendance and completion of tutorials for this course are mandatory. It is strongly recommended that you attend and attempt each tutorial. Completed tutorials must be demonstrated to the TA during your scheduled tutorial in order to receive credit for each tutorial. The tutorial tasks will be provided on the course website. The topics covered in a given tutorial span those taught in lecture for the same week, and will benefit your requisite understanding for the assignments and tests.</p>
		
		
		<h3>SCS Computer Labs</h3>
		<p>Any student taking an SCS course qualifies to have an SCS account. SCS accounts can be created at the following URL: <a href="http://www.scs.carleton.ca/newacct">http://www.scs.carleton.ca/newacct</a>. SCS students can access one of the designated labs for your course. Laboratory machines will not accept your MyCarletonOne login, you must make an account for the labs. The labs are operational 7 days a week 24 hours per day, please be advised that the building will be closed overnight, Mon.-Fri. 23:00-8:00 and on weekends from 17:00-8:00.

			in whole or in part, when the instructor has indicated that the assignment is to be completed
			on an individual basis". Please refer to the course outline statement or the instructor
			concerning this issue.</p>

			<h4 class="uniPolicy">Students with Disabilities Requiring Academic Accommodations</h4>

			Letter of Accommodation, no later than two weeks before the first assignment is due or
			the first in-class test/midterm requiring accommodations. If you only require
			accommodations for your formally scheduled exam(s) in this course, please submit your
			request for accommodations to PMC by the deadlines published on the PMC website:
			<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.carleton.ca/pmc/new-and-current-students/dates-and-deadlines/">http://www.carleton.ca/pmc/new-and-current-students/dates-and-deadlines/</a></p>

			<h4 class="uniPolicy">Religious Obligation</h4>
			<p>Write to me concerning any requests for academic accommodation during the first 
			two weeks of class, or as soon as possible after the need for accommodation is known 
			to exist. For more details visit the Equity Services website <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/equity/accommodation" target="_blank">http://www.carleton.ca/equity/accommodation</a></p>

			<h4 class="uniPolicy">Pregnancy Obligation</h4>
